Get Lit Was born from a desire to see a more enjoyable User Experience from a Social Book cataloging Website. The few websites in this sphere have grown far too comfortable with a mundane user experience. Get Lit aims to bring back a fun & enjoyable Experience to Readers and more importantly those who might be new to reading in community. Reading is a passport to empathy. At Get Lit we strive to help create a more empathetic world. 

# The Story 

The idea for Get Lit was originally conceptualized by our team member Sierra Nutt who was looking to develop an app that improves upon the groundwork that websites like goodread.com set forth. Why can't the utility of a social cataloging website be combined with a fun and fresh UI and UX? Get Lit aims to take the next step towards the future in which reading is promoted in a way that welcomes both experienced and new readers alike, through the wardrobe, into a world of wonder and possibility.

# The App

First we welcome you to our landing page, which first teases the fantastical "pixel art" theme for our application.

Next is the review page, currently in development, to allow for an express and easy way to share your opinions on books.

Our list page, which allows users to share topical lists of books with the Get Lit community.

The heart of the Get Lit experience, being able to set up "book clubs" in which users have the ability to join and participate in discussion around specific books.

User profile page in which you can choose from a variety of animated pixel art sprites to make your profile your own. Includes a comprehensive list of tags and spaces to add a bio and further information.

# The Future 

We at Get Lit aim to continue improving our User Experience in such a way that it  fosters a community of Readers. We hope to create a space where it is as socially advantageous as posting on a Social Media app such as Instagram. This may include the creation of rpg-like elements within the user experience to incentivise reading and developing tools that improve literacy.
